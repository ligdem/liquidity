Liquid Democracy Platform Architecture Overview

1. Modular Architecture

The platform should be built around a modular architecture, where each module can be developed in any programming language and interact with other modules via standardized APIs. Each module should be interchangeable, allowing developers to choose their preferred languages and tools.

Core Modules:

Proposal Management Module: Allows users to submit, discuss, and evaluate proposals before they go to a vote. This module includes tools for public discussion, proposal amendments, and thresholds for moving a proposal to the voting stage.

Voting Module: Manages the voting process, including casting votes and delegations.

Authentication & Identity Management: Manages identity verification, user authentication, and user profiles.

Notification System: Handles email, SMS, and push notifications, reminding users of deadlines and events.

Storage Module: Decentralized file storage for vote and proposal data, securely stored on user devices and optional servers.

Blockchain Module: Manages the recording and verification of votes and proposals on the blockchain (e.g., Liquichain).

Results Display & Analysis: Provides real-time results display, analytics, and user interfaces for reviewing outcomes.


Plugin-based System:

Each core functionality (e.g., notifications, storage, authentication) must have a plugin system. Third-party systems can be swapped in and out, allowing for flexibility in choosing different providers for email, SMS, storage, etc.

Example Plugins:

Email Providers: SendGrid, Mailgun, or custom SMTP solutions.

SMS Providers: Twilio, Nexmo, or local telecom providers.

Storage: IPFS, Arweave, or other decentralized storage solutions.




2. Decentralized Structure

The system should operate in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, with the aim of minimizing the use of centralized servers. Servers will be optional and only used to enhance performance, caching, or UX where needed.

Core Decentralized Components:

P2P Voting Protocol: Users' devices handle vote storage and processing. Each vote is cryptographically signed and shared across the network, ensuring that no centralized point is required for vote collection.

P2P Proposal Management: Users can submit, discuss, and evaluate proposals within the decentralized network. Proposals can be reviewed by peers before they are moved to a vote. This ensures transparency and distributed decision-making from the very beginning of the process.

Decentralized Identity Verification: Users' identities are validated via a P2P verification mechanism (similar to Liquichain) where users confirm each other's identities.

Distributed Storage: Votes, proposals, results, and other critical data will be stored across user devices and decentralized storage solutions like IPFS. This ensures high availability and prevents data loss.

Blockchain for Immutability: A blockchain like Liquichain will be used to ensure the immutability of votes, proposals, and audit trails, reducing the need for centralized data storage.



3. Server-Optional Design

Servers should be optional, used only to improve system performance, user experience, or accessibility. They will not store or process critical vote data but can be used for:

Performance Optimization: Load balancers, caching servers, or CDNs to enhance the speed of user interactions.

User Interface (UI) Enhancements: Optional web servers can serve user-friendly interfaces, reducing the complexity for low-tech users.

Backup or Failover: Servers can be used as secondary backup systems to ensure data redundancy and availability in case the P2P network experiences issues.


4. Proposal Management System

A dedicated proposal management system will allow users to submit, discuss, and amend proposals before they go to vote. The module should support the following features:

Submission: Users can submit proposals with a clear description, objectives, and any supporting documents.

Public Discussion: Each proposal has a dedicated discussion forum where users can debate, ask questions, and suggest amendments.

Amendments: Proposals can be updated or amended based on feedback from the community. Changes to the proposal will be tracked and made transparent to all participants.

Evaluation and Thresholds: Proposals can only proceed to the voting stage after reaching certain thresholds of support, such as a minimum number of endorsements or backers.


5. Deployment Tool

A user-friendly tool must be provided to allow users or communities to deploy the platform according to their needs. This deployment tool will allow customization of the platform by selecting modules and plugins, and it should support:

Customizable Components: Allow users to select their desired modules (voting system, proposal management, authentication, notification).

Easy Integration: Integration with third-party providers (email, SMS, storage) via a plugin system, with minimal configuration.

Automation of Deployment: The tool should automatically deploy the selected configuration to user devices, servers (if chosen), and P2P networks.

Open-source and Flexible: The tool should use open-source technologies where possible, allowing for easy customization and adaptation by the community.


6. Open-source Technology Stack

To maintain flexibility and avoid vendor lock-in, the platform will rely on open-source technologies for key components.

Technologies to Consider:

Blockchain: Liquichain for decentralized vote and proposal storage and immutability.

P2P Protocols: Libp2p, Hypercore Protocol, or WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication.

Decentralized Storage: IPFS, Arweave, or Storj for file storage.

Backend Frameworks: Node.js, Ruby, or Python for lightweight server components (optional).

Front-end Frameworks: Vue.js, React, or Svelte for building modular user interfaces.

Containerization: Docker and Kubernetes for deploying and scaling the platform.
